## Component-3

### Creating a Quarto Website in VSCode

The beginning of the Component-3 description states that you should:

* Make sure the Quarto extension is installed in VS-Code.
* Using VS-Code –> New file –> “Quarto project” –> create a blank Quarto “Website” project in your 5000-lab-1.2 repo call simple_quarto_website

To clarify this portion: you can install the Quarto extension for VSCode by clicking on the "Extensions" panel on the left side of the VSCode interface (or pressing `Cmd`+`Shift`+`X`) and searching for "Quarto" in the extensions search box. The Quarto extension should be the first result:

Once you have this extension installed, there is a bit of a typo in the assignment description about how to create a Quarto **project** (specifically, a **website** project) within VSCode.

Rather than using VS-Code->New file->"Quarto project", in the most recent version of the Quarto extension you should instead do the following:

1. Use the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd Shift-Cmd-P >}} ({{< kbd Shift-Ctrl-P >}} on Windows) to open what's called the **Command Palette** in VSCode. It is a box with a text field in it that should pop up near the top of your screen:

![](images/command-palette.jpeg)

2. Within this Command Palette, start typing the word "Quarto". As you type, it should filter out the irrelevant commands and just show the **Quarto-related** commands.
3. The first command in the list should now be **Quarto: Create Project**:

![](images/create-project.jpeg)

4. Click this command, to begin the process of creating a Quarto project
5. Choose "Quarto Website" on the next screen:

![](images/website-project.jpeg)

6. Choose the folder on your computer where you would like Quarto to create the website (for the lab, for example, you could create a folder called `simple_quarto_website`, and tell Quarto that you'd like to create the website within that folder):

![](images/choose-directory.jpeg)

7. VSCode will now create the website and display the created files "_quarto.yml", "index.qmd", "about.qmd", and "style.css" in the "Explorer" pane on the left side of the VSCode interface:

![](images/quarto-website-vscode.jpeg)

You should now be able to proceed with the lab, by modifying and adding files to this newly-created Quarto website project.

### Multiple Versions of the About Page

There is a step in Component-3 which asks you to:

* Convert `about.qmd` to `about.ipynb` with `quarto convert about.qmd`.

After which (the last bullet in the section) it also asks you to

* modify `_quarto.yml` accordingly `- about.qmd` -> `about.ipynb`

Please note the following points about these two steps:

### Making sure you have added both `href` and `text` data when updating `_quarto.yml`

* When you go to modify `_quarto.yml`, you'll notice that the **Home** link is specified using two pieces of information, `href` and `text`:

```
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
```

* However, the **About** link is specified using a single bullet point, just indicating the name of the file:

```
      - about.qmd
```

* So, when you go to update `_quarto.yml` to change `about.qmd` to `about.ipynb`, make sure that you include **both** pieces of information given for the **Home** link, so that your new link information should now be:

```
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: about.ipynb
        text: About
```

### Specifying the output format for `about.ipynb`

* After running `quarto convert about.qmd`, you can open the generated `about.ipynb` file to view the result.
* However, you'll see that the **metadata block** at the top of the file (the block which starts and ends with `---`) only contains the `title` attribute. That is, the top of the file will look like the following:

```
---
title: "About"
---
```

* But, for your website to correctly render this `.ipynb` file, you'll need to also add information to this metadata block telling Quarto that you'd like it to output **HTML code** when it renders `about.ipynb` for your website.
* To achieve this, add an additional line within the metadata block (i.e., between the starting `---` and the ending `---`), after the `title: "About"` line, specifying `format: html`. If you've done this correctly, your metadata block will now look like the following:

```
---
title: "About"
format: html
---
```

* Once you have added this additional piece of metadata, and saved your changes to the `about.ipynb` file, you will be halfway to successfully rendering this file as a page within your website. For the second half, see the next point.

### Removing the `about.qmd` file

* If you try to `quarto render` and/or `quarto preview` the website now, you may find that clicking the "About" link at the top of the page will show just the raw text content of the `about.ipynb` file, rather than the **rendered**, nicely-formatted and human-readable version. That is, when you click the "About" link, you may just see a plaintext file with the following contents:

```
{
  "cells": [
    {
      "cell_type": "raw",
      "metadata": {},
      "source": [
        "---\n",
        "title: \"About\"\n",
        "format: html\n",
        "---"
      ]
    },
    {
      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "metadata": {},
      "source": [
        "About this site"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "kernelspec": {
      "display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "python3"
    }
  },
  "nbformat": 4,
  "nbformat_minor": 4
}
```

* If you encounter this issue, you can fix it by resolving the ambiguity that Quarto faces in having both `about.qmd` and `about.ipynb` files, and not knowing which one to choose as the file that should be rendered to create the final `about.html` file, the file that will be placed in the `_site` directory that `quarto render` creates.
* To resolve this ambiguity,
  * First, if you're paranoid about losing the information in `about.qmd`, you can back this file up to another folder on your computer.
  * Then (or, you can start here if you're not worried about losing `about.qmd`), delete the original `about.qmd` file.
* Deleting the original `about.qmd` file will thus ensure that Quarto has a single `about` file (in this case, `about.ipynb`) that it knows is the file you want Quarto to render and show when a user clicks the "About" link.

## Component-4 and Component-5: Lorem Ipsum Text

In one of the bullets in both the Component-4 section and Component-5 section of the lab, it mentions the following:

* **Note**: Use of `ipsum lorem` place-holder text is allowed

What this means is just: If you would like "filler text" for your `index.qmd` page, to show what it will look like once it's filled with content (but without having to write hundreds of words of content yourself), you can use a ["Lorem Ipsum text generator"](https://loremipsum.io/){target="_blank"} to auto-generate some number of paragraphs (filled with random Latin words), and place this auto-generated text in your `index.qmd` file.

To see why you might want to do this, consider the difference between the following structure with no filler text:

::: {.callout-note title="Section Headers *Without* Filler Content" appearance="simple"}

### My Heading

#### My Subheading

#### Another Subheading

#### Third Subheading

:::

And the same structure but "filled out" with paragraphs of randomly-generated text:

::: {.callout-note title="Section Headers *With* Filler Content" appearance="simple"}

### My Heading

If you think this second version looks nicer than the first, and shows more clearly how the headers **separate out** different pieces of content, you can use this "lorem ipsum" text as filler (until you replace it with your own original writing!).

## Component-6

### Linking to the Slideshow From Your Main Page

In Component-6, the assignment asks you to create a slideshow, with the first two steps being:

1. Create a `slides` subfolder, within `simple_quarto_website`
2. Create a file within the `slides` subfolder called `slides.ipynb`

And then it asks you to modify the `yaml`-format metadata block---this is the block of specially-formatted key-value pairs at the **top** of the **first cell** within the `slides.ipynb` file, that looks like the following (for example):

```yaml
---
title: "My Slideshow"
---
```

To specify to **Quarto** that you'd like it to **render** this `slides.ipynb` file specifically as a **Reveal.js slideshow**, you'll need to add the following additional key-value pair to this metadata block (which, again, should be at the top of the first cell within `slides.ipynb`):

```yaml
format: revealjs
```

Meaning that, if your original metadata block just had the title, like in the example above, now it will have two pieces of information for Quarto:

```yaml
---
title: "My Slideshow"
format: revealjs
---
```

Once you've specified this format, though, it is still a bit tricky to **preview** the slideshow (to make sure that modifications you make are actually appearing in the slideshow, for example), since the Quarto extension for VSCode does **not** provide a nice "Render" button for `.ipynb`-format files like it does for `.qmd`-format files.

So, you can make your life slightly easier by **adding a link to the slideshow** from your website's **main** navigation bar. To do that, you'll need to modify your website's `_quarto.yml` file, which contains the global settings for the website. If you open this file at this point in the project, it should look something like:

```yml {filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "simple_quarto_website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.ipynb

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
```

Notice the portion within the value of `website` (the indented portions under `website:`) with the key `navbar`, and within that value, the key `left`. Every bullet point underneath this `left` key will correspond to a **link** on the **top navbar** of your website, where the `left` key indicates that these links will be **left-aligned** (you could add a new key `right:`, and some links underneath that key, and those links would be right-aligned on the top navbar).

So, to add a link to the slideshow you are creating in `slides/slides.ipynb`, we'll need to modify two things in this `_quarto.yml` file. First, since Quarto will sometimes complain and/or get confused if some links have `href` and `text` tags while others do not have this tag, let's change the link that just contains `about.ipynb` to have an `href` and `label`, like:

```yaml
- href: about.ipynb
  text: About
```

The YAML format requires that elements of a list (like the list of left-aligned links under the `left` key) line up in terms of indentation, so make sure that the full `_quarto.yml` file now looks something like:

```yml {filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "simple_quarto_website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: about.ipynb
        text: About

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
```

Now we should be able to add another, third link to this list, allowing us to go directly to the slideshow we're making in `slides/slides.ipynb`. To do this, add a new element to the `left` list by adding another "bullet point" (another `-` character), then set the `href` value to be exactly that path (`slides/slides.ipynb`) and the `text` value to be "My Slides" (or, any title you'd like). Your `_quarto.yml` file should now look something like:

```yml {filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "simple_quarto_website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: about.ipynb
        text: About
      - href: slides/slides.ipynb
        text: Slides

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
```

and now when you **preview your website** by running the `quarto preview` command in the **terminal** (from within the root directory of your website, which should be named `simple_quarto_website`), you should see three links in the top navbar: one to "Home", one to the "About" page, and a third to "Slides".

Now, when you actually **click** the "Slides" link, it may not show anything, or it may show a bunch of non-human-readable raw code (which is actually the `.json` structure underlying a `.ipynb` file). This, however, is a separate issue, that you'll need to tackle: how to get Quarto to know that it should show the **Reveal.js presentation** as the **rendered form** of the `slides/slides.ipynb` file. And that is part of the challenge of the assignment. As a hint, though, you should break it down into steps, to check exactly **where** this rendering is going wrong (if the slideshow doesn't render as intended when you click the new "Slides" link):

1. If you run the `quarto preview` command from **within** the `slides` folder (rather than the **root** folder of your website, `simple_quarto_website`), does it display correctly as a slideshow?
2. Is the **first cell** in your `slides.ipynb` file in the correct format for containing file metadata? (File metadata can only be entered in "raw" or "markdown" cell types. If the first cell is, for example, a "Python" cell type, Quarto will be unable to read your metadata block, as it will think it's Python code rather than YAML code).
3. Does the **file metadata** actually **exist in a block** at the top of the first cell? As mentioned above, the top of the first cell in your `.ipynb` file (which should be a "raw" or "markdown" type cell) should look something like

```yaml
---
title: "Slides"
format: revealjs
---
```

If you don't see text that looks like this at the top of the first cell in your `slides.ipynb` file, please add it and try to preview the file again (both from the root folder of your website and, for debugging purposes, also from the `slides` subfolder, as mentioned in step #1 above)
