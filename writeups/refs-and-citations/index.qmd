For your homework and your project, we ask you to integrate **references** into your Quarto documents, a process which invovles the following steps:

1. Obtain references to scholarly papers/books and combine information about these references into a `references.bib` file, and
2. Include **citations** to these references within your Quarto document.

This walkthrough will show you the details of each step.

First things first, there are many ways to obtain references, and many formats that the references can come in, but the format used by Quarto is called **BibTeX**. Long story short, there are two ways to obtain **BibTeX-style reference info** for a given paper or book. The first way (using **Google Scholar**) is simple, and will let you immediately generate a `references.bib` file. The second way (using a **reference manager** like Zotero or Mendeley) takes a bit longer to get set up, but will save you SO much time in the long run. In this writeup we'll use the Google Scholar approach, but I highly recommend reading [the writeup on using Zotero](../zotero/index.qmd){target="_blank"} to learn the Zotero/Mendeley approach as well.

## Step 1: Obtaining References and Creating a `.bib` File

### Step 1.1: Obtaining Your First Reference

An easy way to quickly obtain references in a format where you can immediately cite them in your Quarto documents is to use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com){target="_blank"}. If you open that link, and search for a topic you're interested in, it should show you a big list of results that looks like:

![Results from searching for "Einstein" on Google Scholar](images/einstein.jpeg){#fig-einstein}

Now, if you choose one of these references and click the "Cite" button at the bottom of the result, it should display a popup (modal) dialog that looks like the following:

![The popup (modal) dialog which comes up if you click the "Cite" link at the bottom of the Google Scholar result](images/cite_popup.jpeg){#fig-cite-popup}

Now, if you click on the "BibTeX" link, the first link at the bottom of this popup (modal) window, it should immediately open a new tab containing a plaintext version of the **BibTeX data** for this reference, like:

![The BibTeX data for the selected reference, obtained by clicking the "BibTeX" link at the bottom of the "Cite" popup](images/bibtex_data.jpeg)

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}

If you don't see this plaintext data, that probably means that your browser is set to **download** rather than just **display** .bib files, so just look in your Downloads folder for the downloaded file (it might have some weird name, and it might not have a `.bib` extension, but that's ok, it will still open in a text editor like VSCode), open it in a text editor, and it should contain exactly the above data.

:::

However you end up with this plaintext reference data, **copy and paste it** into a new text file (in VSCode, you can create a new plaintext file using `Cmd`+`N`), and **save this file** as **`references.bib`**.

That's it! You now have a fully-fledged `references.bib` file, that looks as follows:

```tex {filename="references.bib"}
@book{barnett2005universe,
  title={The Universe and Dr. Einstein},
  author={Barnett, Lincoln and Einstein, Albert},
  year={2005},
  publisher={Courier Corporation}
}
```

### Step 1.2: Adding Additional References

Our `references.bib` file only contains one reference at the moment, but we can quickly add more by repeating the above process: find another reference you'd like to cite, click the "Cite" link underneath that reference, click the "BibTeX" link at the bottom of the "Cite" dialog box, and copy the resulting (plaintext) data into your `references.bib` file. Make sure to **separate** each reference within the `.bib` file by at least one space, so that for example it may look like the following:

```tex {filename="references.bib"}
@book{barnett2005universe,
  title={The Universe and Dr. Einstein},
  author={Barnett, Lincoln and Einstein, Albert},
  year={2005},
  publisher={Courier Corporation}
}

@book{einstein2017einstein,
  title={Einstein on peace},
  author={Einstein, Albert},
  year={2017},
  publisher={Pickle Partners Publishing}
}
```

## Step 2: Citing the `references.bib` File From Within Quarto

Now that you've created your `references.bib` file, and filled it with two references, we need to carry out two final steps if we want to **cite** references from this file when creating content in a `.qmd` file.

### Step 2.1: Telling Quarto About Your `.bib` File

Let's say you are modifying a file called `introduction.qmd`, and in this file you'd like to **cite** one or more of the references contained in `references.bib`. Hopefully it's becoming a bit of a habit now, that if we want to give Quarto some information to use when it goes to **render** the `.qmd`, we need to include this information within the **metadata block** at the top of the page. So, if you are editing `introduction.qmd`, and its metadata block currently looks like

```yml
---
title: "Introduction"
author: "DSAN 5000 Student"
---
```

You'll need to add an additional line to this metadata block telling Quarto where it can **find** the `.bib` file---that is, you'll need to give it a **relative path** telling it how to get **from** the `introduction.qmd` file **to** the `references.bib` file. The syntax for this metadata entry looks like `bibliography: <path-to-file>`. So, if our `references.bib` file happened to be in the **same exact folder** as the `introduction.qmd` file, we could simply add

```yml
bibliography: references.bib
```

to the metadata block. Or, if you placed the `references.bib` file in a **subdirectory** of the directory containing `introduction.qmd` (say, a subdirectory called `assets`), you would need to tell Quarto to look for the `.bib` file within this subdirectory:

```yml
bibliography: assets/references.bib
```

If the `.bib` file instead was placed one level **above** the location of the `introduction.qmd` file in your directory tree, then the following would tell Quarto to look there:

```yml
bibliography: ../references.bib
```

Once you have pointed Quarto to the location of your `references.bib` file, all that's left is to actually **cite** one or more of the references within the **content** of `introduction.qmd`.

### Step 2.2: Citing `references.bib` Entries Within a Quarto Document

For this final step, recall what the contents of the `.bib` file you created look like:

```tex {filename="references.bib"}
@book{barnett2005universe,
  title={The Universe and Dr. Einstein},
  author={Barnett, Lincoln and Einstein, Albert},
  year={2005},
  publisher={Courier Corporation}
}

@book{einstein2017einstein,
  title={Einstein on peace},
  author={Einstein, Albert},
  year={2017},
  publisher={Pickle Partners Publishing}
}
```

From this structure, we can see that `@book` tells Quarto that this entry is a book (this could, alternatively, be `@article` or `@conference-proceedings`, for example), and then after the line containing this **entry type** information we see key-value pairs containing the relevant information: the **title**, **author**, **year** and **publisher** of each book.

The key thing to notice in our case, however, is the "code" which is given immediately **after** the **entry type**: `barnett2005universe` and `einstein2017einstein`. These are called **citation keys**, and they are what we use to **refer to** entries in our `.bib` file from within our `.qmd` documents!

So, for example, if we started writing the content of our `introduction.qmd` page **before** we created the `references.bib` file, it may have looked like:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="`introduction.qmd` *Before* Setting Up References"}

``` {.md .code-overflow-wrap}
In this project we are studying the life and work of Albert Einstein. Barnett (2005) is a key work about Einstein's scientific contributions, while Einstein (2017) contains a collection of Einstein's writings on peace in the years before and after World War II.
```

:::

The issue is: If we kept it like this and started writing dozens and dozens of paragraphs, but our boss came along and said "Hey! We need you to switch to a different citation format!", you would have to go back through your document and manually update each in-text citation to match the new format, plus you would need to (a) manually create a "References" section at the end, and (b) manually update it if your boss requests a change in how the end-of-article references should be formatted.

So, instead, we use the **citation keys** mentioned above (which should be present for each entry in your `references.bib` file) to **indicate to Quarto** when we'd like to cite something, and Quarto will handle the rest! If your boss comes along and requests a change, you no longer need to manually update each citation/reference: Quarto allows you to specify formatting as a set of **global options**, which it then **automatically applies** to each citation and reference. For example, to utilize this system, we can now update our `introduction.qmd` file to look as follows:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="`introduction.qmd` *After* Setting Up References"}

``` {.md .code-overflow-wrap}
In this project we are studying the life and work of Albert Einstein. @barnett2005universe is a key work about Einstein's scientific contributions, while @einstein2017einstein contains a collection of Einstein's writings on peace in the years before and after World War II.
```

:::

And when Quarto goes to render this `introduction.qmd` file (for example, after you run `quarto render` in the root folder containing your website files), it will see these **citation keys** indicated by the `@` symbol followed by the key from the `references.bib` file, and style the citation by filling in all of the relevant information for this item from `references.bib`. To see the difference, the following two blocks show the rendered version of this paragraph **without** and then **with** Quarto's reference-management features set up:

::: {.callout-note title="Rendered `introduction.qmd` Content *Without* Citation Keys" appearance="simple"}

In this project we are studying the life and work of Albert Einstein. Barnett and Einstein (2005) is a key work about Einstein's scientific contributions, while Einstein (2017) contains a collection of Einstein's writings on peace in the years before and after World War II.

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Rendered `introduction.qmd` Content *With* Citation Keys" appearance="simple"}

In this project we are studying the life and work of Albert Einstein. @barnett2005universe is a key work about Einstein's scientific contributions, while @einstein2017einstein contains a collection of Einstein's writings on peace in the years before and after World War II.

:::

Notice how, in the rendered version **with** citation keys:

* The parenthesized year in each citation is now colored [blue]{style="color: blue;"}, and when you hover your mouse over these years it should show a popup containing **more information** about the cited book.
* Quarto **also** auto-generated a "References" section for our article, which you should see at the bottom of this page.
