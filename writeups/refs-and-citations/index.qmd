For your homework and your project, we ask you to carry out two specific steps to integrate **references** into your Quarto documents:

1. Obtain references to scholarly papers/books,
2. Combine information about these references into a `references.bib` file, and
3. Include **citations** to these references within your Quarto document.

This walkthrough will show you the details of each step.

First things first, there are many ways to obtain references, and many formats that the references can come in, but the format used by Quarto is called **BibTeX**. Long story short, there two ways to obtain **BibTeX-style reference info** for a given paper or book. The first way (using **Google Scholar**) is simple, and will let you immediately generate a `references.bib` file. The second way (using a **reference manager** like Zotero or Mendeley) takes a bit longer to get set up, but will save you SO much time in the long run. I'll start with the Google Scholar approach, but I highly recommend reading onwards to learn the Zotero/Mendeley approach as well.

## Simple But Non-Scalable Method: Google Scholar

### Step 1: Obtaining References

An easy way to quickly obtain references in a format where you can immediately cite them in your Quarto documents is to use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com){target="_blank"}. If you open that link, and search for a topic you're interested in, it should show you a big list of results that looks like:

![Results from searching for "Einstein" on Google Scholar](images/einstein.jpeg){#fig-einstein}

Now, if you choose one of these references and click the "Cite" button at the bottom of the result, it should display a popup (modal) dialog that looks like the following:

![The popup (modal) dialog which comes up if you click the "Cite" link at the bottom of the Google Scholar result](images/cite_popup.jpeg){#fig-cite-popup}

Now, if you click on the "BibTeX" link, the first link at the bottom of this popup (modal) window, it should immediately open a new tab containing a plaintext version of the **BibTeX data** for this reference, like:

![The BibTeX data for the selected reference, obtained by clicking the "BibTeX" link at the bottom of the "Cite" popup](images/bibtex_data.jpeg)

If you don't see this plaintext data, that probably means that your browser is set to **download** rather than just **display** .bib files, so just look in your Downloads folder for the downloaded file (it might have some weird name, and it might not have a `.bib` extension, but that's ok, it will still open in a text editor like VSCode), open it in a text editor, and it should contain exactly the above data.

:::

However you end up with this plaintext reference data, **copy and paste it** into a new text file (in VSCode, you can create a new plaintext file using `Cmd`+`N`), and **save this file** as **`references.bib`**.

That's it! You now have a fully-fledged `references.bib` file! It only contains one reference at the moment, but we can quickly add more by repeating the above process: find another reference you'd like to cite,
